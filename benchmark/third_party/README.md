## picorv32

> PicoRV32 is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set. It can be configured as RV32E, RV32I, RV32IC, RV32IM, or RV32IMC core, and optionally contains a built-in interrupt controller.

Made by [Yosys Headquarters](https://github.com/YosysHQ).

## SERV

> SERV is an award-winning bit-serial RISC-V core. In fact, the award-winning SERV is the world's smallest RISC-V CPU. It's the perfect companion whenever you need a bit of computation and silicon real estate is at a premium.
